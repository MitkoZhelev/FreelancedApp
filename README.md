Here is my Blockchain Application that I have wrote. This represents a system of independent users who bid to a certain project. 

They have the ability to put down for how much money they would finish the project. 

Every user has their public address automatically taken and it is being added into the contract.

If a user is chosen, there is a contract being created for the period of the project. 

Once this is done, they will finish the project and if nothing goes wrong, the contract finishes.

There is one very valuable security feature, here I made a contract within a contract, so if the main contract is destroyed, there would be one more ongoing.
